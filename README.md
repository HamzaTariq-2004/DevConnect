**DevConnect API â€“ CI/CD with Jenkins**

A simulated project to learn **Jenkins, Git, GitHub, and CI/CD practices** as a DevOps Engineer. This project mimics a small team developing a basic RESTful API using Python (Flask) and deploying it locally using **Docker Compose**. It uses **Jenkins for automation** and **GitHub for version control and collaboration**.
